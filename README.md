### Greetings and Salutations! ðŸ‘‹ 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... finding the right fit for me professionally and building out a personal project or two
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... MaterialUI
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... really anything that grabs my interest; I have a grab bag of hobbies from music to gaming (generally console but I'm trying to expand my horizons) to NBA basketball to self teaching a little data science
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... networking and finding problems that I'll enjoy trying to solve
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... thinking and learning (former teacher), any of the hobbies above, what it's like living in Delaware
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ... he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... not exactly a single fact, but here is something I like thinking about: [The Fermi Paradox](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html)
